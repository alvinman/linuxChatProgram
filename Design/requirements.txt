Objective
    - Write and test a chat/server application.
    - Server accepts connections on specified port
    - Once clients have established connection, the server  will echo whatever it receives to all other 
        connected clients

Contraints
    - Use select to design and implement the application
    - The server will maintain a list of all connected clients (host names) and display the
        updated list at the server end
    - The server will echo the text strings it receives from each client to all other clients
        except for the one that sent it
    - Each chat participant will not only see the text string, but also the client (hostname)
        it was from
    - Optionally, a client can specify (CL argument) that the chat session can also be dumped
        to a file.
